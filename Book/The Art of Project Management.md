# The Art of Project Management
------

# Schedule

## Why Schedule

* time commit
* coordination
* split job

## Errors

* weak leadership
* unclear goals
* poor communication

## Principles

* rule of thirds: design, code & test
* divide & conquer

## Estimation

* classify with accuracy
* provide needed info & time to estimate
* trust
* high-level project goals
* based on previous jobs
* enough specification
* techniques: PERT

## Suggestion

* Milestone length matches volatility
* opt in vision, skeptical in schedule
* Good design
* Schedule checkpoints
* Team knows our schedule philosophy
* work experience
* teamwork experience
* take risk early

# Plans

## Organization impact
* Requirement power
* Design power(ways to do it)
* Tech power(engineering)
* Budget power(resources)
* Review frequency

## Process
* MRD (Opportunity)
* Vision (What)
* Specification (How)
* WBS

Requirement -> Ideas -> Spec

## Perspectives
* Business (desire, feature & profit)
* Technical (how, quality, reuse & capability)
* Customer (how, problem & feature)

## Checklist
* Groupings of customers
* Info & needs of customers
* Customer usage
* Potential customer
* Techical capability
* Profit & cost on timeline
* Market window time
* Competitors

## Customer research
* Focus group
* Survey
* Site visits
* Usability study
* Market research

Common problem is over-reliance on a single approach.

## Requirements
* Medium to low level plan.
* Reference: Exploring Requirements: Quality Before Design (Donald & Gerald, 1989)
* Problem statements (current)
* Scenarios (objective)

------
# Vision

## Quality
* Simplifying: answering questions
* Intentional: good goals
* Consolidated: summary ideas
* Inspirational: realworld problem
* Memorable: direct

## Key Points (4.4 Page 74)
* Statement
* Priority 1 scenarios/feature
* Priority 2 scenarios/feature
* For whom and What problem
* Why use ours (Comparison)
* Competitors
* What will not be done
* Reasons of failure, how to avoid
* How to divide the work(high level)
* Assumptions and dependencies
* Benefit for organization
* Stakeholders

## Draft timeline
* Rough draft
* Leader review
* Public first draft
* All-hands meeting
* Final version

## Other
* How detail depends on team
* Goals level: Project, Team & Individual
* Require one primary writer
* Visualization
* Daily worship

------
# Ideas

## Quality requirements
* plan for iteration
* find wrong assumptions
* find missing info
* priority
* find unspecific words

## Design exploration
* problem space
* constraints by requirements
* feedback to requirements

## Principle
* bad ideas
* think out of box?

Ideas should solve the target problem(requirement) and satisfy the constraint.

## Good questions
* 1) Focusing questions
* narrow down & missing key info
* "what problem are you trying to solve"
* 2) Creative questions
* directions not yet explored
* enlarge problem space
* 3) Rhetorical questions
* not really seeking answers
* assuming self smarter than answerer

## Bad leads to good
Know good ideas only after many bad ones

## Improvisational rules
* Yes, and...
* No half-assing
* No blocking questions (keep going and direct)
* Make the other guy look dood

* Moments when most creative
* Persistence
