# The Art of Project Management
------

# Schedule

## Why Schedule

* time commit
* coordination
* split job

## Errors

* weak leadership
* unclear goals
* poor communication

## Principles

* rule of thirds: design, code & test
* divide & conquer

## Estimation

* classify with accuracy
* provide needed info & time to estimate
* trust
* high-level project goals
* based on previous jobs
* enough specification
* techniques: PERT

## Suggestion

* Milestone length matches volatility
* opt in vision, skeptical in schedule
* Good design
* Schedule checkpoints
* Team knows our schedule philosophy
* work experience
* teamwork experience
* take risk early

# Plans

## Organization impact
* Requirement power
* Design power(ways to do it)
* Tech power(engineering)
* Budget power(resources)
* Review frequency

## Process
* MRD (Opportunity)
* Vision (What)
* Specification (How)
* WBS

Requirement -> Ideas -> Spec

## Perspectives
* Business (desire, feature & profit)
* Technical (how, quality, reuse & capability)
* Customer (how, problem & feature)

## Checklist
* Groupings of customers
* Info & needs of customers
* Customer usage
* Potential customer
* Techical capability
* Profit & cost on timeline
* Market window time
* Competitors

## Customer research
* Focus group
* Survey
* Site visits
* Usability study
* Market research

Common problem is over-reliance on a single approach.

## Requirements
* Medium to low level plan.
* Reference: Exploring Requirements: Quality Before Design (Donald & Gerald, 1989)
* Problem statements (current)
* Scenarios (objective)

------
# Vision

## Quality
* Simplifying: answering questions
* Intentional: good goals
* Consolidated: summary ideas
* Inspirational: realworld problem
* Memorable: direct

## Key Points (4.4 Page 74)
* Statement
* Priority 1 scenarios/feature
* Priority 2 scenarios/feature
* For whom and What problem
* Why use ours (Comparison)
* Competitors
* What will not be done
* Reasons of failure, how to avoid
* How to divide the work(high level)
* Assumptions and dependencies
* Benefit for organization
* Stakeholders

## Draft timeline
* Rough draft
* Leader review
* Public first draft
* All-hands meeting
* Final version

## Other
* How detail depends on team
* Goals level: Project, Team & Individual
* Require one primary writer
* Visualization
* Daily worship

------
# Ideas

## Quality requirements
* plan for iteration
* find wrong assumptions
* find missing info
* priority
* find unspecific words

## Design exploration
* problem space
* constraints by requirements
* feedback to requirements

## Principle
* bad ideas
* think out of box?

Ideas should solve the target problem(requirement) and satisfy the constraint.

## Good questions
* 1) Focusing questions
* narrow down & missing key info
* "what problem are you trying to solve"
* 2) Creative questions
* directions not yet explored
* enlarge problem space
* 3) Rhetorical questions
* not really seeking answers
* assuming self smarter than answerer

## Bad leads to good
Know good ideas only after many bad ones

## Improvisational rules
* Yes, and...
* No half-assing
* No blocking questions (keep going and direct)
* Make the other guy look dood

## More tips
* Book on creative thinking
* Moments when most creative
* Persistence
* ThinkPak

------
# Specs

3 use: what, phase(milestone), feedback

## What to specify
* requirements(criteria)
* feature (non-technical scenario)
* Technical specs
* work items
* test criteria

## Seperate design and spec
* Seperate
* Simplify
* Is this what you need to do best work?

## Open issues

### Manage
* Track and write down.
* well-understood issues.
* Shotgunning

### Checklist
* when and who?
* isolate to scenario
* pending resolutions
* can we cut it?
* divide
* obstacle

## Review

* Meet in person
* Read spec first
* Chief need to attend
* Open to who has read the specs
* Ask questions

Question list:

* spec to work item
* weakest point of design & interfaces
* prioriy
* quality & test
* simpler design?
* possible changes
* dependencies
* bg info
* concerns
* reuse?
* UI accessibility & localization
* security risks


------
# Decisions

## Questions
* Core problem
* Impact
* Cost of being wrong
* Time window
* Previous exp
* Any expert?
* Approval & feedback required

## Options

* Singular & Comparative
* List options, pros & cons

Checklist:

* Do nothing option
* Proof
* Tough questions
* Have dissenting options
* Hibrid options
* Relevant impacts
* Lightweight
* Refine until stable

Tricks

* Discussion => clarity & understanding
* Eliminate the impossible
* Check the simplest solution
* Reflect (fresh air)

## Data

Beaware:

* Misinterpretation
* Data manipulation
* Exaggerated precision

Try: 

* Direct commmunication (first-hand)
* Questioning

## Improve Decision-making
* Make hard choices
* Review

Review checklist:

* Resolved the core?
* Helped the project progress?
* Was there better info?
* Did vision & spec help?
* Key people?
* Other problems (good/bad)?
* Hindsight
* Authority
* Reuse exp?

# Communication

## Model
* Transmitted
* Received
* Understood (Cognitive & questions)
* Agreed
* Action

## Relationship

It enhances communication.

## Problems
* Assumption (Clarify step by step)
* Lack of clarity (What they hear)
* Not listening
* Dictation
* Problem mismatch (another issue is here)
* Personal attacks
* Derision, ridicule & blame (no trust)

## Roles
* Clarifying the roles & responsibility
* Shared & unique roles
* Resolve issues

## Motivation
* Ask advice
* Follow advice
* Clear roadblocks

* Honest demands
* Inspiring
* Teaching
* Asking

# Process

## People hate...
* assume idiot
* no trust
* waste time
* no respect (set up to fail)
* read stupid things

## Good process
* general + team unique

* can change or eliminate
* impacted people agree

## How to create
* define the problem
* small meeting for proposals
* pilot
* repeat or accept

## Managing process from below
* Shield
* Bet against
* Ignore

## Good email
* concise, simple, direct
* action & deadline
* prioritize (fewer emails)
* people probably not read
* no old stories
* seperate FYIs
* telephone

## Facilitate Meetings
* host position
* listen & reflect (do you mean ...?)
* direct (back to agenda; ask silent people)
* end the conversation (you two figure this out)
* make history

## Kinds of meetings
* highly interactive discussion
* reporting
* status and project review
* level of interaction <-> number of attendance

## Meeting checklist
* right people
* sit or stand
* prepare (issue list; slide, demo & handouts)
* No laptop
* On time
* End of clear steps & owners
