## Plot

Flower
She answers all the code of stone
She put flowers where i had my had
It must the call of destiny
A destiny i havent see before

Stone never turns soft
It only knows how to grow
Should i hate myself?
Deep in my mind I knew it wasn't possible
Yet everyday I just want to see her smile

Watch from distance away
She talks with others
Feels so faraway and so tiny

Protect her from all harm
I will return to dust
Settled but remembered by the earth
Join the stream to the sea
A greater journey
No more sorrow

Finale: Valkyrie

## Plot
So young in the world of summoners
Trained yet fresh
Dream: Travel & witness

Yet hesitates with someone she wont love
Conflicts of feeling & Sympathy
Fear of commitment

She was so much stronger than before
Learning from failures and depress, as well by hurting someone important
As she goes, the path seems further and tougher
yet she realizes it was what it takes, for a dream.

A young valkyrie has waken.
