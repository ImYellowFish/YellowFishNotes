## Plot

Flower
She answers all the code of stone
She put flowers where i had my had
It must the call of destiny
A destiny i havent see before

Stone never turns soft
It only knows how to grow
Should i hate myself?
Deep in my mind I knew it wasn't possible
Yet everyday I just want to see her smile

Watch from distance away
She talks with others
Feels so faraway and so tiny

Protect her from all harm
I will return to dust
Settled but remembered by the earth
Join the stream to the sea
A greater journey
No more sorrow

## BGM
Theme: Gentle Jena
Reflection: 绀碧の彷徨
Finale: Valkyrie

## Plot
So young in the world of summoners
Trained yet fresh
Dream: Travel & witness

Yet hesitates with someone she wont love
Conflicts of feeling & Sympathy
Fear of commitment

She was so much stronger than before
Learning from failures and depress, as well by hurting someone important
As she goes, the path seems further and tougher
yet she realizes it was what it takes, for a dream.

A young valkyrie has waken.

## Event
曾经是在海上有过潇洒的时光，后来不知为何，船和水手都没了.
船长也流落到岸上。曾经的水刀也失去了光辉。

讨论玄学(佛学)，看佛经. 看空一切？

抽奖，志在必得，结果抽了个树枝

做一个卡牌游戏，以刀塔传奇为背景，学习一下王权。要不要支持几包烟钱。
结果抽了一个月，剧本写了出来，女主是屠芙. 屠芙看了一下之后，把kunkka给砍了一顿。

老男人终会觉醒。在一个阳光灼人的午后，抽完一支烟之后，他突然想起了一本书，
悉达多。经历过苦修，迷茫，荣华，爱，伤痛，人终于能大彻大悟。

输了就是垃圾。
